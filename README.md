This is the SD-Card example for esp-arduino 8266/ESP32/S2/S3/2C3/C6.
For the ESP32 you will need the Arduino Alpha 3 Release v3.0.0.

Copy the SDRoot to the root of your SD card sodat index.htm is in the root.
Load the software in the ESP, and now you can see all the content of the SD card and edit it.

It is based on the work that 
Mohammed Rezwanul Islam has done see his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJP3Ie3nE7c&t=5s
